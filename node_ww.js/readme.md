Node.js is designed for server-side development, while browsers are for client-side applications.

    APIs: Node.js provides APIs for file system, networking, and OS, which browsers do not.
    Browsers provide DOM, fetch, and UI APIs not available in Node.js.
    Global Objects: Node.js uses global; browsers use window or self.
    Modules: Node.js uses CommonJS (require) and ES modules (import); browsers use ES modules or plain <script> tags.
    Security: Browsers run in a sandbox with limited access; Node.js has full access to the file system and network.
    Event Loop: Both environments use an event loop, but Node.js has additional APIs for timers, process, etc.
    Environment Variables: Node.js can access environment variables (process.env); browsers cannot.
    Package Management: Node.js uses npm/yarn; browsers use CDNs or bundlers.
